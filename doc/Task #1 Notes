Q1.1.

For coordinate points, we use floats
For angle, we use double

Floats have less precision than a double, but have much computational cost than doubles. Coordinate points don't need the high level precision that we need with the angle, especially since gyros in our robot have a high error (2-5 degrees/minute).

Thus, in order to maximize our accuracy and time complexity, we chose to use a double for our angle theta and floats for our x and y coordinates

Gyro Calibration:
Odometry Calibration:
	To calibrate our odometry, we ran a simple test to track the change in the number of ticks against a set distance. The following table displays our results:
	
	Trial #1: 28.25in							Total Ticks		Ticks/Inch
		Left Encoder:	170023 to 173623		3600			127.434
		Right Encoder:	180336 to 183872		3536			125.168
	Trial #2: 29.75in
		Left Encoder:	173623 to 177458		3835			128.908
		Right Encoder:	183872 to 187588		3716			124.908
	Trial #3: 19.25in
		Left Encoder:	177458 to 179931		2473			128.468
		Right Encoder:	187588 to 189968		2380			123.636
	Average:
		Left Encoder: 	128.27 ticks/in			5050 ticks/meter
		Right Encoder:	124.571 ticks/in		4904 ticks/meter
