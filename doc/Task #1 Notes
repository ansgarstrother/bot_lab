Q1.1.

For coordinate points, we use floats
For angle, we use double

Floats have less precision than a double, but have much computational cost than doubles. Coordinate points don't need the high level precision that we need with the angle, especially since gyros in our robot have a high error (2-5 degrees/minute).

Thus, in order to maximize our accuracy and time complexity, we chose to use a double for our angle theta and floats for our x and y coordinates
