Blue Tape Detection:

General Method -
1. Store initial image if in RGB
    - More methods can be applied if we have color, otherwise we can't further improve results
    
2. Binarize a copy of the image with a threshold at 0.3 
    - Parameter derived from experimentation
    - More experimentation may be needed
    
3. Build a Gaussian filter and filter the image
    - See matlab fspecial('gaussian', [5 5], 2);
    - See matlab imfilter(I, G, 'same');

4. Run an (Sobel) edge detection on image
    - See matlab edge(I);

5. Scan image on large patches to look for strong lines of best fit for edges
    - See more details in section: Image Segmentation

6. If we still have initial RGB image, we can confirm our line by testing RGB values of pixels above edge



Image Segmentation -
1. Scan first column and last column of an image for a white pixel
    - The intuition is that the boundary rays we care about will always enter from the left or right hand side of an image, so it should naturally start at the edge of the camera
2. Once a white pixel is found begin a traversal to determine its linearity
    - Build a 70x70 patch with this point in the middle and on the far left/right
    - segment the edge until we find a pixel with more than one neighbor, or until we are at the bounds of our patch
    - After the segment is collected, run statistical analysis to determine its linearity
    - Record linear fit
    - Disallow lines going up/down (no more than 10 pixels in the up/down direction in a row)

Notes:
    - Start at the bottom and work up so we get the edge adjacent to the table first
    - If we get a strong correlation, break and move on to the other edge of the camera

    - Real time data is taking forever. Reduce quality of image?

Revised Process:
1. Work on One Image (saves computational complexity and space)
2. Grayscale the image to magnify the blue tape darker than other objects in the image
3. Run a binarization-like analysis on the bottom half of the image to make the blue tape black
4. Scan up the image in search of black pixels
	- Once a black pixel is found, record the pixel location
	- color it and its previous neighbor white


To get ground truth, find init point of blue line, and final point of blue line, calculate slope, then compare both the init point, the final point, and the slope (with the slope having the most weight) with the line detection algorithm and the real data manually selected from all training images.

Camera Calibration:
    - Intrinsic: focal length, center coordinate (c_x, c_y)
        - Solved through affine matrix transformation and point correspondences between real world coordinates and pixel coordinates
    - Extrinsic: history of transformations of robot frame
        - chain of transformation matrices (rotation and translation from one robot frame to another)


Radial Distortion:
Parameters: A = 1.527995
            B = -0.000910

Relation:   r' = 1.527995 * r - 0.000910 * r^2



Occupancy Grid Resolution:
    - 1000cm x 1000cm
    - Chosen because the occupancy grid needed to be large enough to account for a large sized maze, but small enough to make it time efficient
    - Ten meters is plenty size for a maze considering the size of the room
